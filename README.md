# HouseSensorsTracker

## The Goal
We need to know what's the status of specific sensors like temperature sensors.
In first step we just need to know what the temperature of heat carrier inbound from city heating network, temperature before/after heat exchanger, and return temperature
In next steps we want to track the noise and detect the motion
